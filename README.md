## For Candidates

  

Navigate through each task using the homepage. Look for comments marked as "TASK", "GOAL", "REQUIREMENTS" to understand requirements. Complete the missing code according to the detailed instructions provided.

  

## Testing

  

After completing each task, run unit tests to verify your solution:

to run the test one by one.

  

Tests are designed to validate the correctness and functionality of your implementation.
